# Reactive Block Grid

### What does it do ?

This plugin will create a reactive [Isotope](http://isotope.metafizzy.co) masonry for you. If you update or filter your collection/cursor it will be automatically reflected in the layout.
### Live demo
You can find a live demo here : [http://smeevil-responsive-block-grid.meteor.com](http://smeevil-responsive-block-grid.meteor.com)

### Why?

I was looking for a solution that would help me animate newly inserted templates in a block grid that was ordered by newest first. Using the default options of just rendering your collection in an each block made for a jarring user experience when a **new item** would be **added** or **removed** in this way. For example you are looking at an item and all of the sudden you see something flicker and you are looking at a different item. Using an animation makes for a more **natural transition** and understanding of what happend. As I could not find any **_easy_** solution yet, I started to make one myself.

### Usage

**Installation:**

~~~js
meteor add smeevil:reactive-block-grid
~~~

**Basic usage:**

The most basic option to use it in your templates is as follows :
~~~js
{{> reactiveBlockGrid cursor=myCursor template='myTemplate'}}
~~~

To add classes to the generated `<ul>` and `<li>`; you can pass them using the parentClass and childClass options like so :
~~~js
{{> reactiveBlockGrid cursor=myCursor template='myTemplate' parentClass='medium-block-grid-12' childClass='medium-block-grid-3'}}
~~~



**Options:**

You can pass the following isotope options to the template:  transitionDuration, layoutMode, gutter, columnWidth, and percentPosition. Please look at the [isotope read me](http://isotope.metafizzy.co) for more information on these options.

**Full example:**
~~~js
{{> reactiveBlockGrid cursor=myCursor template='myTemplate' transitionDuration='1.5s' layoutMode='fitRows' gutter=20 columnWidth='.gutter-width'}}
~~~
